    <p>
      We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or
      navigate the Services. This information does not reveal your specific
      identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device
      and usage information, such as your IP address, browser and device
      characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs,
      device name, country, location, information about how and when you use our
      Services, and other technical information. This information is primarily
      needed to maintain the security and operation of our Services, and for our
      internal analytics and reporting purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like many businesses, we also collect information through cookies and
      similar technologies.
    </p>
    <p>The information we collect includes:</p>
    <ul>

        <em>Log and Usage Data.</em>&nbsp;Log and usage data is service-related,
        diagnostic, usage, and performance information our servers automatically
        collect when you access or use our Services and which we record in log
        files. Depending on how you interact with us, this log data may include
        your IP address, device information, browser type, and settings and
        information about your activity in the Services&nbsp;(such as the
        date/time stamps associated with your usage, pages and files viewed,
        searches, and other actions you take such as which features you use),
        device event information (such as system activity, error reports
        (sometimes called&nbsp;‘crash dumps’), and hardware settings).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>Device Data.</em>&nbsp;We collect device data such as information
        about your computer, phone, tablet, or other device you use to access
        the Services. Depending on the device used, this device data may include
        information such as your IP address (or proxy server), device and
        application identification numbers, location, browser type, hardware
        model, Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier, operating
        system, and system configuration information.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>Location Data.</em>&nbsp;We collect location data such as
        information about your device’s location, which can be either precise or
        imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type and
        settings of the device you use to access the Services. For example, we
        may use GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation data that
        tells us your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt
        out of allowing us to collect this information either by refusing access
        to the information or by disabling your Location setting on your device.
        However, if you choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain
        aspects of the Services.

    </p>
    <p>
      If you are a resident in the European Economic Area (EEA) or United

      When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal

      securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further
      processing until deletion is possible.

      safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic

      will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access,
      steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect

      within a secure environment.

      <strong><u>Withdrawing your consent:</u></strong
      >&nbsp;If we are relying on your consent to process your personal
      information,&nbsp;which may be express and/or implied consent depending on
      the applicable law,&nbsp;you have the right to withdraw your consent at
      any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by

    <p><strong>11. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong></p>
    <p>
      Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
      applications include a Do-Not-Track (‘DNT’) feature or setting you can
      activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
      online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no
      uniform technology standard for&nbsp;recognising&nbsp;and implementing DNT
      signals has been&nbsp;finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to
      DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates
      your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is
      adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that
      practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
